Implementing PV to Categories is necessary to support SKU

CP has 4 types:
* Normal
* Key Prop (Used to determine SPU)
* Sale Prop (Used to determine SKU)
* Bound Prop (Unchangeable)

CP has options:
* Required,

Types are mutually exclusive. Use normal Enum

Options are NOT mutually exclusive, use FlagEnum to encode and decode for DB storage.
